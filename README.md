TODO:project summary

What do we do? How are we different?

What makes a business stand out in the 21st century? More often than not, doing exceptional work starts with an effective team.  And the most effective teams don't form by luck or chance. They are built, by identifying and utilizing the strengths of each member in the group. At Spectrum we identify both the temperment and interaction styles of our applicants to illuminate both why "we do what we do", and how we are most effective at doing it. By organizing teams around both of these principals we leverage current scientific models to produce groups who are able to maximize their productivity and excel at achieving their goals.

Interaction style and temperment

Research shows that people are not the same, and their interaction styles can be roughly defined as a basic dichotomy: those who communicate by directing others, and those who communicate by informing others. These categories can further be refined by assigning roles which identify a given individuals prefered work style. We describe these roles as: "In charge", "Charting the course", "Get things going" and  "Behind the scenes".  By organizing teams around these roles we promote the ability of each individual to maximize their potential and the group to meet its' goals.

Get started now!

To further aid in assigning the right job to each candidate we have matched each of these roles with a color. Just search our extensive database for those applicants who meet your qualifications and role criteria and we make creating your ideal team a breeze.
